        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>I have fond memories of being on vacation as a kid and playing long games of Risk with my cousins late into the night. But sometimes things just went on too long. As the game progressses and the number of armies accumulate, the time it takes to roll starts to become a drag, with rolling easily taking ten or more minutes per turn. It starts to feel less like a game of global domination and more like a game of endless rolling.</p>

        <p>That's the problem I wanted to solve with this site. By letting the computer handle the rolling, the game can speed up and the focus can move back to strategy. Just enter your rolling preferences and the computer will handle the rest. You can even add additionaly stop conditions, and it will automatically adjust the number of dice rolled as needed. I hope you find it helpful.</p>
