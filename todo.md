# Todo

- document what I'm doing with creating about and 404 pages and also with react helmet.
- Create a good readme. Have a link to live site.
- Spell check
- Have another person look at it and use it.
- GitHub showed a security vulnerability in package-lock.json for the url-parse package. See what if anything I need to do.
- Add a robots.txt? Sitemap?
- Decide deploy method. Set up needed stuff (like homepage in package.json and github pages specific package). Document all I did and what the build/deploy process is.
- Run build and test that locally and with google speed/accessibility test. Note that serve is installed globally. I can serve the build version of the app using "serve -s build". Also, see if I need to do anything else here in terms of redirecting to index.js, etc.
- Final last check of build version w/ console open and looking for errors.


- After deploy:
  - Check on older IE/Edge that I still want to support and see what if any pollyfills or changes are needed (core-js is good for pollyfills).
  - Check on a few Android devices.
