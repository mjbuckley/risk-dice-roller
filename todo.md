# Todo

- Mobile styling
- Test in different browsers.

- Remove PWA stuff before initial build.
- Look over City Weather App notes to see if there's anything important from last time that I might be forgetting.
- Decide on browsers to support. Install core-js for pollyfills if needed.
- Run build (but only after PWA stuff removed) and test that locally and with google speed/accessibility test. Note that serve is installed globally. I can serve the build version of the app using "serve -s build"
- Spell check
- Have another person look at it and use it.
- Create a good readme. Have a link to live site.
- Final code/comment cleanup (remove any lingering console.logs).
- Add stuff needed to auto deploy on push and to handle browser history on github pages, then deploy.
