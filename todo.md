# Todo

- Fix console errors: keys on mapped element, table issue, others?
- At one point if you click in one of the optional fields but didn't enter anything it caused errors to be displayed when submitted (although tabbing seems ok). I couldn't get this to happen more recently, so perhaps something else I did fixed this, but play around with this and make sure it isn't still happening.
- Test all the different possibilities for errors with different inputs. Maybe make some actual tests.
- Figure out design. Do I need to split into multiple pages? What to do for intro. Have a reset form button. Maybe have some links that scroll to sections when clicked (like roll scrolling to results). Better ways to display errors.
- Add note somewhere about how roll number is automatically adjusted as needed.
- Look into using Font Awesome's React stuff as a way to use dice and maybe some arrow icons?
- Add some sort of check for really larger numbers that might crash things and aren't realistic.
- Remove PWA stuff before initial build.
- Look over City Weather App notes to see if there's anything important from last time that I might be forgetting.
- Remove any lingering console.logs.
- Decide on browsers to support. Install core-js for pollyfills if needed.
- Run buld and test that locally and with google speed test. Note that serve is installed globally. I can serve the build version of the app using "serve -s build"
- Have my name and a link to my github repo somewhere on site.
- Create a good readme. Have a link to live site.
- Note.md is is pretty good shape, but clean up/finalize.
- Add to github.
- Deploy.



### Short Term Notes

- NPM ERROR NOTE: I get the following error from npm: "npm WARN ajv-keywords@3.1.0 requires a peer of ajv@^6.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself." Keep in mind if I ever have an issue.
