# Todo

- notes.md is fine but maybe reorganize a bit or just make a touch more approachable.
- Spell check (home page, errors, results, about, 404, readme, notes, github).
- Have another person look at it and use it.
- GitHub showed a security vulnerability in package-lock.json for the url-parse package. See what if anything I need to do.
- Add a robots.txt? Sitemap?
- Test the final build with the google speed/accessibility test and also use with console open to look for any final errors. Note that serve is installed globally. Use ```serve build``` to simulate how GitHub Pages works.

- After deploy:
  - Check on older IE/Edge that I still want to support and see what if any pollyfills or changes are needed (core-js is good for pollyfills).
  - Check on a few Android devices.
  - Check links on GitHub README and also on live site.
